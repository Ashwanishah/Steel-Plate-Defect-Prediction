# Steel Plate Defect Detection

This project aims to classify defects in steel plates using machine learning. It analyzes various features, such as pixel area, perimeter, luminosity, and defect indicators, to identify defect types. This classification helps automate quality control in manufacturing.

## Project Overview

- **Notebook**: `Steel plate defect.ipynb` – A Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow, including data loading, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Dataset**: `train.csv` – A CSV file with labeled data describing steel plate characteristics and various defect types.

## Dataset Details

The dataset (`train.csv`) contains 35 columns, categorized as follows:

- **Features**: Various numerical and categorical attributes that describe the defect properties, such as coordinates (`X_Minimum`, `X_Maximum`, etc.), measurements (`Pixels_Areas`, `Perimeter`), luminosity indicators, and other calculated indices.
- **Labels**: Binary indicators (1 for presence, 0 for absence) for different types of defects, including:
  - `Pastry`, `Z_Scratch`, `K_Scatch`, `Stains`, `Dirtiness`, `Bumps`, `Other_Faults`

Each row represents a steel plate sample with these measurements and labels.

## Project Workflow

The project follows these main steps:

### 1. Data Loading

The dataset is loaded, and an initial review is conducted to understand its structure, identify missing values, and assess feature types.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA provides insights into the data distribution and relationships among features. This includes:
- **Distribution Analysis**: Visualizing the distributions of numerical features to detect skewness or outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying correlations between features to determine dependencies.
- **Class Imbalance**: Checking for imbalance in defect type labels to address potential biases in model training.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing prepares the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary. Common steps include:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filling or removing missing values to maintain dataset integrity.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardizing numerical features to ensure all data is on a similar scale.
- **Encoding**: Converting any categorical variables to a numerical format if present.

### 4. Model Building

Multiple machine learning models are trained to classify the defect types. Typical models considered for this task include logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods. Each model is tuned and evaluated based on its performance metrics.

### 5. Evaluation

Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to understand their effectiveness. These metrics help to assess how well the model identifies defect types and highlight any areas for improvement.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and essential packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files to your local environment.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute `Steel plate defect.ipynb` to follow each project step.
3. **Experiment and Modify**: Adjust parameters, try additional models, or apply different preprocessing techniques as needed.

## Project Results

The notebook summarizes model performance and feature importance for defect classification. Final metrics, key insights, and recommendations can be found in the evaluation section.

## Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering**: Developing additional features or transformations could improve model performance.
- **Model Tuning**: Applying hyperparameter tuning may further optimize results.
- **Advanced Models**: Exploring more complex models, like neural networks, could potentially yield higher accuracy.
